- Better statistics if contract is correct
    - Consider alternative trump suit
    - Consider actual trump suit
    - Consider actual height (4NT or 5 level may be too high)

- BUG consider minor suit fit for slam (other rules for choosing trump suit than when bidding game)

- Bidding can get out of hand after 13+ pull from 3NT
    - After minimum without minor fit, opener should bid 4NT

- BUG When zooming for controls, opener should bid 3NT with a minimum.
However, the number of hcps of opener is not contained in the list hcpRelayerToSignOffInNT, because controlBidCount is 1 (not 0 because of zoom!)

- If it is not a good grand slam, don't relay with 5NT or higher!

- Bid a reasonable contract when bidding got too high, instead of passing in a misfit.

- Make decision to continue/stop relaying in ScanningOther fase better
