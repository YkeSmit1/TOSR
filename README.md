# TOSR
Program to test and learn the TOSR bidding system

The goal of the program will be two-fold:
1) Teaching new players how to become familiar with the TOSR system.
2) Get statistical analyses about the system. For example, how often will the relayer be the declarer.

TODO
- Fix some bugs from the basic system
- Implement control asking and control scanning
- Implement teaching mode
- Create a rules database for the Tarzan system
- Implement more statistics.
